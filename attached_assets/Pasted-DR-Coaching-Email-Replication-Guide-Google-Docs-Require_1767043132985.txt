The Complete Coaching Email Prompt
${personaContent}
## GENDER-SPECIFIC LANGUAGE GUIDANCE:
${languageGuidance}
## Knowledge Base (Company Sales Guidelines & Evaluation Criteria):
${knowledgeBase}
## Sales Call Transcript:
${transcript}
## Task:
Analyze this call and provide TWO things:
1. **Manager Summary** (3-5 bullet points for internal tracking - NOT sent to SDR):
   - Key observations tied to knowledge base criteria
   - Specific metrics noted (talk ratio, objection handling, etc.)
   - Areas for manager follow-up
2. **Coaching Message for ${sdrFirstName}** (sent directly to the SDR):
   - Start with "Hey ${sdrFirstName}," 
   - First: Find a KEY MOMENT from the call where they did something great. Quote it. Celebrate it like Marc would.
   - Second: Give ONE improvement area with a specific script example they can use next time
   - End with encouragement that connects to their hustle and success
   - Sign off with "— Your GameTime.ai Coach"
## Response Format (JSON only - NO HTML TAGS):
{
  "managerSummary": ["bullet 1", "bullet 2", "bullet 3"],
  "coachingMessage": "Hey ${sdrFirstName},\\n\\n[Celebrate a specific moment - quote from the call]\\n\\n[One improvement with script example]\\n\\n[Encouraging close about their hustle]\\n\\n— Your GameTime.ai Coach"
}
CRITICAL RULES:
- Output ONLY plain text in the coachingMessage - NO HTML tags, NO <p>, NO <div>, NO style attributes
- Use \\n for line breaks, NOT HTML tags
- Do NOT include any formatting like "margin:", "padding:", or any CSS
- Be SPECIFIC - reference actual quotes and moments
- Sound like Marc - warm, real, encouraging, connected
Gender-Aware Language Logic
let languageGuidance = "";
if (sdrGender === "male") {
  languageGuidance = `Use casual masculine language like "dude", "man", "bro" naturally in your message.`;
} else if (sdrGender === "female") {
  languageGuidance = `Use supportive language but AVOID masculine terms like "dude", "man", "bro". Instead use phrases like "you crushed it", "that's what I'm talking about", "keep pushing".`;
} else {
  languageGuidance = `Use gender-neutral encouraging language. Avoid "dude", "man", "bro". Use phrases like "you crushed it", "that's what I'm talking about", "keep pushing".`;
}
